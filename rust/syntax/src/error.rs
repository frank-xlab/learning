// Rust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable errors. For a recoverable error, such as a file not found error, itâ€™s reasonable to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array.

// By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts unwinding, which means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it encounters. But this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. The alternative is to immediately abort, which ends the program without cleaning up. Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resulting binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by adding panic = 'abort' to the appropriate [profile] sections in your Cargo.toml file.
// [profile.release]
// panic = 'abort'
//

// the Result enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude
enum Result<T,E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}

use std::io::ErrorKind;

// ErrorKind::NotFound

    let f = File::open("hello.txt");

    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", e),
            },
            other_error => {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", other_error)
            }
        },
    };

// called unwrap
// If the Result value is the Ok variant, unwrap will return the value inside the Ok. If the Result is the Err variant, unwrap will call the panic!
let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
// Using expect instead of unwrap and providing good error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier.
let f = File::open("hello.txt").expect("Failed to open hello.txt");
// The error message used by expect in its call to panic!

    match f.read_to_string(&mut s) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(s),
        Error(e) => Err(e),
    }
}

// If the value of the Result is an Ok, the value inside the Ok will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value is an Err, the Err will be returned from the whole function as if we had used the return keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling code.
