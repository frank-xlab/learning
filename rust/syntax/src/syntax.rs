// Define User Struct
struct User {

// Tuple Struct
// Define Color Struct
struct Color(u32,u32,u32);
// Destructure them into their individual pieces, you can use a . followed by the index to access an individual value
let black = Color(0,0,0);
// black.0 / black.1 / black.2

// Unit-like structs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type but donâ€™t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.
